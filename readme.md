We provide Jupyter notebooks that support our dataset processing, label analysis, and machine learning modeling, under the `TECHNICAL_VALIDATION/` folder. These materials aim to enhance transparency and reproducibility of our findings.

## Requirements

To reproduce the analyses, install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We recommend using **Python 3.10**. Some dependencies may not be fully compatible with Python 3.11 or above. All notebooks were developed and tested in a Jupyter Lab environment using Python 3.10.

## Reproducibility

All random seeds were fixed to ensure reproducibility. The notebooks are organized to run sequentially, starting from data description to model training and evaluation.

## Notebook Overview

### `Dataset_Records.ipynb`
Summarizes the dataset structure and provides a high-level overview of data sources and preprocessing steps.

### `Label_Analysis.ipynb`
Analyzes the distribution of self-reported labels (e.g., perceived arousal, stress, suppression, valence), investigates missing values, and explores correlations and group differences (e.g., by gender or role).

### `ML_analysis.ipynb`
Builds machine learning models to predict each of the following target variables:  
- `perceived_arousal`  
- `perceived_stress`  
- `perceived_suppression`  
- `perceived_valence`  

The following models are implemented and evaluated:
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- XGBoost  
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)  

Each model's performance is assessed using standard metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1 score), and cross-validation is applied for robust evaluation.
