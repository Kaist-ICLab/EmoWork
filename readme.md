# EmoWorker: Technical Validation Code

This repository contains the code for technical validation of the EmoWorker dataset. The dataset itself is available at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/uploads/15181220).

## üöÄ Getting Started

We recommend using **Python 3.10**. Some dependencies may not be fully compatible with Python 3.11 or above. All notebooks were developed and tested in a Jupyter Lab environment using Python 3.10.

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the notebooks:
- TECHNICAL_VALIDATION/Dataset_Records.ipynb
- TECHNICAL_VALIDATION/Label_Analysis.ipynb
- TECHNICAL_VALIDATION/ML_analysis.ipynb

## üìù Notebook Overview

### `Dataset_Records.ipynb`
Summarizes the dataset structure and provides a high-level overview of data sources and preprocessing steps. This notebook includes:
- Data collection protocol details
- Signal preprocessing steps
- Data quality checks
- Feature extraction methods
- Missing data analysis
- Data synchronization procedures

### `Label_Analysis.ipynb`
Analyzes the distribution of self-reported labels (e.g., perceived arousal, stress, suppression, valence), investigates missing values, and explores correlations and group differences (e.g., by gender or role). Key analyses include:
- Label distribution visualization
- Missing data patterns
- Correlation analysis between different measures
- Statistical tests for group differences
- Temporal analysis of emotional responses

### `ML_analysis.ipynb`
Builds machine learning models to predict each of the following target variables:  
- `perceived_arousal`  
- `perceived_stress`  
- `perceived_suppression`  
- `perceived_valence`  

The following models are implemented and evaluated:
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- XGBoost  
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)  

Each model's performance is assessed using:
- Accuracy
- F1 score
- Precision and Recall
- ROC-AUC (where applicable)
